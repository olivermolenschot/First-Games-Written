# First-Games-Written
These are the first programming games I wrote.
Both of the files are games I developed when I was learning how to code.
The blackjack file contains code for a game of blackjack that can be played in the terminal. I developed it in order while learning how to use functions 
and classes.
The Rock Papper Scissors is also a game that can be played on the terminal.

If you want to test them out, feel free to download the file.
